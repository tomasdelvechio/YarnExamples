# Nutch Indexer Implementation

This is my interpretation of Nutch[1] MapReduce Indexing, based on description presented in MRorNot[2] paper.

The implementation is based on Hadoop 2.5.0.

The Posting list generated contain term, doc id and term frequency and the format is:

```
term\docId1:Freq1;docId2:Freq2;docId3:Freq3;docId4:Freq4...
```

The file is sorted by word and docId. In the future, will be implemented an order by Freq (i.e. support early termination techniques for retrieval)
